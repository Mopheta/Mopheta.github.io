            music, reading novels and technology articles, play 'futbol', as
            well as spending time with friends and playing video games. One of
            my favorite writers is Mr. John Katzenbach. author of among others
            the well-known novel 'the psychoanalyst'.
          </p>
          <p className="paragraph">
            My experience in recent years has been quality assurance, manual
            testing, ux. I have long been studying react.js, node.js, as well as
            sass, mongoDB, etc. My intention is to develop more and more with
            front-end technologies.
